        "4.What does the intercept c represent in the equation Y=mX+c?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans:\n",
        "- In business-friendly terms, the intercept “c” signifies the baseline output value when\n",
        "the input variable X is positioned at zero.\n",
        "In short: it’s the starting value of Y before X has any impact.\n",

        "\n",
        "Ans:\n",
        "- The least-squares method is leveraged to minimize the overall error between the predicted line and the actual data points. In operational terms, it ensures the regression line is the best-fit line by reducing the squared distance between observations and predictions, thereby optimizing model accuracy and analytical reliability.\n",

        "7.How is the coefficient of determination (R²) interpreted in Simple Linear Regression?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans:\n",
        "- The coefficient of determination (R²) quantifies how effectively our regression line\n",
        "explains the variance in the outcome variable.\n",
        "- **In simple terms:**\n",
        "- it’s the percentage of the target’s behavior that is successfully accounted\n",
        "for by the predictor.\n",
        "- Example:\n",

        "8.What is Multiple Linear Regression?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans:\n",
        "- Multiple Linear Regression is essentially a data-driven forecasting framework that models how one outcome is influenced by several independent variables simultaneously.\n",
        "- **In simpler terms:**\n",
        "- It’s a method used to predict a value (like price, marks, sales, etc.) using more than one input factor at the same time, enabling more holistic and accurate decision insights.\n",
        "\n",
        "9.What is the main difference between Simple and Multiple Linear Regression?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans:\n",
        "- From a high-level analytics perspective, the distinction is fairly straightforward:\n",
        "- **Simple Linear Regression** operationalizes a predictive relationship using one\n",
        "independent variable to forecast the target metric.\n",
        "- **Multiple Linear Regression** extends the decision framework by leveraging several independent drivers simultaneously to deliver more comprehensive predictive insights.\n",
        "\n",
        "10.What are the key assumptions of Multiple Linear Regression?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans:\n",
        "- **Linearity** – the output variable is expected to maintain a straight-line relationship with each predictor, enabling predictable trend modeling.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Independence** – the error terms should not influence each other, ensuring clean, decorrelated insights across observations.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Constant variance (Homoscedasticity)** – the spread of prediction errors remains stable across all ranges of the predictors, ensuring consistent performance quality.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Normality of errors** – the residuals are assumed to follow a normal distribution,supporting statistically robust conclusions.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **No strong multicollinearity** – predictors shouldn’t excessively overlap in meaning,so each variable delivers unique business value rather than redundant signals.\n",
        "\n",
        "11.What is heteroscedasticity, and how does it affect the results of a Multiple Linear Regression model ?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans:\n",
        "- Heteroscedasticity basically means the spread of errors isn’t constant across all values of the predictors. In other words, the prediction errors get bigger or smaller indifferent parts of the data, instead of staying steady.\n",
        "- Impact on Multiple Linear Regression:\n",
        "  - When this imbalance occurs, it distorts the reliability of coefficient estimates and inflates or deflates standard errors, which ultimately undermines the trustworthiness of p-values and can lead to sub-optimal decision-making based on the model’s outputs.\n",
        "\n",
        "12.How can you improve a Multiple Linear Regression model with high\n",
        "multicollinearity?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans:\n",
        "- Remove highly-correlated inputs to de-duplicate information and stabilize\n",
        "coefficients\n",
        "- Use regularization frameworks (Ridge/Lasso) to strategically penalize redundant variables\n",
        "- Apply dimensionality-reduction (like PCA) to compress overlapping predictors into cleaner components\n",
        "\n",
        "13.What are some common techniques for transforming categorical variables for use in regression models?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans:\n",
        "- **Label encoding** – assign numeric IDs to each category to streamline model consumption.\n",
        "- **One-hot encoding** – spin up binary flags for every category, enabling the algorithm to capture category presence without implying order.\n",
        "- **Ordinal encoding** – map categories to a ranked scale when there’s a natural priority\n",
        "sequence.\n",
        "- **Target (mean) encoding** – replace categories with their average target value to\n",

        "\n",
        "14.What is the role of interaction terms in Multiple Linear Regression?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans:\n",
        "- In a data-driven context, interaction terms essentially capture the combined impact of twopredictors when their joint influence on the target variable isn’t purely additive.\n",
        "- In plain terms: sometimes two factors together change the outcome differently than each alone.Interaction terms help the model account for that partnership effect, enabling more granular and strategically aligned predictions.\n",
        "\n",
        "15.How can the interpretation of intercept differ between Simple and Multiple Linear Regression?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans:\n",
        "- In Simple Linear Regression, the intercept is the predicted value of y when thesingle x is 0.\n",
        "- In Multiple Linear Regression, the intercept is the predicted value of y when all independent variables are 0. It’s less intuitive because having all x equal to 0 might not make real-world sense.\n",
        "\n",
        "16.What is the significance of the slope in regression analysis, and how does it affect predictions?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans:\n",
        "- In regression analysis, the slope shows how much the dependent variable (what you want to predict) changes for each 1-unit change in the independent variable (the input).\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Positive slope**: As the input increases, the output increases.\n",
        "- **Negative slope**: As the input increases, the output decreases.\n",
        "\n",
        "- It directly affects predictions because it determines the direction and rate of change inyour forecast.\n",
        "\n",
        "17.How does the intercept in a regression model provide context for the relationship between variables ?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans:\n",
        "- The intercept in a regression model is the starting point: it shows the expected value of the outcome (dependent variable) when all input factors (independent variables) are zero. It gives context by anchoring the relationship.\n",
        "\n",
        "18.What are the limitations of using R² as a sole measure of model performance?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans:\n",
        "- R² alone has limitations:\n",
        "  - 1. Doesn’t show errors – it won’t tell you if predictions are far off.\n",
        "  - 2. Can be misleading – adding more variables can increase R² even if they don’t help.\n",
        "  - 3. Not for non-linear models – may give wrong impression if the relationship isn’t linear.\n",
        "  - 4. Ignores overfitting – a high R² doesn’t mean the model will work on new data.\n",
        "\n",
        "19.How would you interpret a large standard error for a regression coefficient ?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans:\n",
        "- A large standard error for a regression coefficient means there’s a lot of uncertainty about the estimated effect of that variable. In simple terms, the coefficient might not be reliable, and small changes in the data could lead to big changes in the estimate.\n",
        "\n",
        "20.How can heteroscedasticity be identified in residual plots, and why is it important to address it ?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans:\n",
        "- Heteroscedasticity shows up in residual plots when the spread of residuals (errors) gets wider or narrower as the predicted values change—like a funnel shape.It’s important to fix because it violates regression assumptions, making predictions and confidence intervals less reliable.\n",
        "\n",
        "21.What does it mean if a Multiple Linear Regression model has a high R² but low adjusted R²?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans:\n",
        "- It means your model fits the training data well (high R²) but has too many unnecessary variables (low adjusted R²), so it may not generalize well to new data.\n",
        "\n",
        "22.Why is it important to scale variables in Multiple Linear Regression ?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans:\n",
        "- Scaling variables in Multiple Linear Regression is important because it ensures all features are on a similar scale, which:\n",
        "  - 1. Prevents one feature from dominating the model just because it has larger values.\n",
        "  - 2. Improves convergence when using optimization algorithms like gradient descent.\n",
        "  - 3. Makes interpretation easier if you compare coefficients.\n",
        "\n",
        "23.What is polynomial regression ?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans:\n",
        "- Polynomial regression is a type of regression analysis where the relationship between the input (independent variable) and output (dependent variable) is modeled as a polynomial instead of a straight line.\n",
        "\n",
        "- In simple words:\n",
        "   - it helps fit curvy lines to data instead of just straight lines, so it can capture\n",

        "24.How does polynomial regression differ from linear regression ?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans:\n",
        "- Polynomial regression is like linear regression but with a twist: instead of fitting a straight line, it fits a curve to the data. Linear regression = straight line, polynomial regression = curved line to capture more complex patterns.\n",
        "\n",
        "25.When is polynomial regression used ?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans:\n",
        "- Polynomial regression is used when the relationship between the input (independent variable) and output (dependent variable) is curved, not straight. It helps model trends that a simple straight-line (linear) regression cannot capture.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "- It’s basically like linear regression but includes powers of 𝒙to capture curves in the data.\n",

        "27.Can polynomial regression be applied to multiple variables ?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans:\n",
        "- Yes. Polynomial regression can be applied to multiple variables by creating polynomialterms for each variable and their combinations. This is called multivariate polynomial regression. It models non-linear relationships between several inputs and the output.\n",
        "\n",
        "28.What are the limitations of polynomial regression ?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans:\n",
        "- Polynomial regression has a few key limitations:\n",
        "  - 1. Overfitting risk – High-degree polynomials can fit the training data too closely, capturing noise instead of true patterns.\n",
        "  - 2. Poor extrapolation – Predictions outside the data range can be wildly inaccurate.\n",
        "  - 3. Complexity grows fast – Higher degrees make the model harder to interpret.\n",
        "  - 4. Sensitive to outliers – Extreme values can distort the curve significantly.\n",

        "Ans:\n",
        "- You can evaluate the fit of a polynomial model using these methods:\n",
        "  - 1. Visual check – Plot the curve and see if it follows the data without overfitting.\n",
        "  - 2. Train/Test split – Check how well the model predicts new data.\n",
        "  - 3. Cross-validation – Split data multiple times to see how consistent the model performs.\n",
        "  - 4. Error metrics – Use RMSE, MAE, or R² to measure prediction accuracy.\n",
        "  - 5. Adjusted R² – Accounts for extra terms, helps avoid overfitting.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Keep it balanced: enough degree to fit, but not too high to overfit.\n",
